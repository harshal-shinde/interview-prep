# Greedy Method

if some solution seems fessible then add to our solution
Finding solution based on fessiblity and our custom requierments

Alogorithm
```
a = array of data
n = number of elements in array

  greedy(a, n) {
    for i = 0 to n do {
      x = select(a)
      if(fessible(x)) {
        solution = solution+x
      }
    }
  }
